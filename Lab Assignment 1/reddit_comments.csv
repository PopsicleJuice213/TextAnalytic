Minesh1989,"I have been using iPhone 11 for three years and decided to change and bought iPhone 15 Plus three weeks ago and I am very happy with it as it has everything I want and the battery is excellent.

If you need Apple AI, go for the iPhone 16. Otherwise, the iPhone 15 is a very good choice.",2025-02-25
Abdulaziz_S,I always recommend getting the latest iPhone.,2025-02-25
BrouwersgrachtVoice,"I'm going for the 15. I'm not interested for the Apple Intelligence at all, so I see no reason to buy the 16. And I don't see much differences.",2025-02-25
tyr1699,"I was in a similar boat couple of weeks ago and I went with the 15. Pretty happy with it and yes, I liked the design and colours of the 15 much better than 16. 

In terms of day to day use and software experience, I don't think you'll miss out on much with the 15 (apart from AI)",2025-02-25
sunday9987,"I came from an 11 to a 15 plus. I do not regret it one bit. Better camera, better battery life, less weight are 3 things I can think of off the top of my head where 15 plus is better. So yes I encourage you to get the 15 and preferably plus model.",2025-02-25
pavocadism,I love color of 15 especially pink and blue one. Apple Intelligence is too hyped and not worth.,2025-02-25
Melodic-Audience1568,"If the price difference is negligible, obv go for 16 else 15 is a great device too and will easily get the job done üëç",2025-02-25
BeMaelle,"i had both and went for the 15. But it was like 350$ price difference and for that, and because i was delusional thinking i have to pay over a 1000$ for a new phone to feel that wow factor and happiness, i slapped myself and kept the 15. It was 750 for 512gb and its all i need in a phone. 
16 is perfect, 15, FOR That reduced price, hits the sweet spot. But 16 will be that at one point, like early 2026 with that reduced price!
There is nothing i truly miss ab the 16, but macro, and more light in ultra-wide at night, better battery and 8gb ram are sweet! But in all these aspects the 15 is already good enough. 

Especially camera. 48mp compact sized photos, default 24mp, 2x 12mp and a okay ultra wide are chef's kiss coming from a 13. 
Just so much more detailed and less auto processed.
Btw the new photographic styles are cool to play around with- and if i would have familiarize my self even further i probably would've missed them, BUT the simplicity of the old styles and just being used to them so much and not having them on the 16, also was a factor. I wish they implemented the old styles too to choose between. They just hit the spot. But the new black and whites styles, also amber, ros√© and the more cyan undertones were dopeüôèüèªüíØ
You can create looks and atmospheres like never before with them- looks like edited for a magazine from a professionalist. But again, for easy to access styles, more convenient imo. Also not a single old style i was able to recreate. A bit sad.",2025-02-25
princess_tatsumi,"i've had the 15 for almost a year, it's been great! the battery is nice, it doesn't overheat and there's been none of the glitching that people usually complain about",2025-02-25
Party-Drop-7469,15 heats a lot. Dunno about 16,2025-02-25
Valoupiloulpb,"I have my iPhone 15 since July 2024 and was coming from an iPhone Xr. I may pass for an Apple fan but it‚Äôs a game changer to but not for my sister who came from an iPhone 11. It depends on what you‚Äôre expected about this phone as a tech fan or not. 
If you need Apple Intelligence and can spend more money you should go on an iPhone 16, but the 15 is a really good phones and can do pretty much the same things as the 16, except heavy games and AI. 
You were saying that you prefer the 15 colors but let‚Äôs be honest, you‚Äôll not be able to see the colors if you put on a case. 
Tell us which phone you‚Äôll choose !",2025-02-25
NotYourFaveHeadache,"I just bought an iPhone 15 3 days ago, and I'm loving it so far! I just really love the shade of pink of the iPhone 15. ü©∑",2025-02-26
Stunning-Hat152,16 anyday,2025-02-25
Writ_sh,"I waited for the 16E specs  announcements and decided to buy the 16, 256 GB in Aquamarine. Since the phone is used for 4-5 years ( passed on to the kids etc) it made sense to buy the latest.",2025-02-25
raman_bhadu,Definitely 16 it only doesn‚Äôt have AI as people talk but lot of other hardware improvements,2025-02-25
Maximum-Goose-9545,"Go for 16, I got 15 last year just bc my android died and wouldn‚Äôt charge anymore. Can‚Äôt complain",2025-02-25
Hazys,"So far seem ok partly I just bought it last year march so coming to one year. Battery seem still ‚Äú ok ‚Äú last me till night before I go bed charge it , usually left 30, 40 or 50 percent depend that day how I use it. I don‚Äôt play games or watch video a lot , I do view my home security cam it do drain a bit the battery beside normal surfing and social media oh I don‚Äôt see TikTok or even download the app. TikTok drain a lot battery. That me how I use it quite simple nothing much and lastly I don‚Äôt take photo or video much. I‚Äôm not a camera or video person. If plan for future iPhone i will stick to base model still will not go for pro or max version. Before iPhone 15 base I use iPhone 7 Plus.",2025-02-25
Messyworld78,I have an iPhone 15 bought in May 24 and it has a frustrating problem of the Home Screen freeze during random incoming calls everyday ‚Ä¶.. Apple says they don‚Äôt have a solution for the problem and have asked me to keep updating the IOS releases and pray for the solution ‚Ä¶.. there seem to be many customers facing this issue ‚Ä¶. So better don‚Äôt go for the 15 ‚Ä¶. Hopefully the iphone 16 doesn‚Äôt have that bug !!,2025-02-25
zeusjmk21497,"Only option with Ai and little upgradation opt for 16 otherwise 15 itself an outstanding one 
Heating case is there while using camera and while l charging too after latest update it is little too much
Rest outstanding performance",2025-02-25

Talks_With_TJ,"15 series is fire, 16 series is a dumpster I‚Äôd wait for the 17",2025-02-25
Deleted,Personally I‚Äôd go for 16 cause u had the diagonal cameras in 15. 16 looks way better and is nice too but if you don‚Äôt care about those things and it fits within your budget go for any,2025-02-25
Shookinnit,Is it worth it? I really like the iPhone 15 colours. And I‚Äôve heard that apple ai only comes to Europe on April and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll use it than‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been deciding between these two for a long timeee,2025-02-25

ReginaDelMare,"I just bought the 15 a few days ago. I could‚Äôve chosen the 16, since the price difference wasn‚Äôt much, however I am in love with the pink on the 15! Besides, the difference from the 16 is minimal - I‚Äôd only highlight the new chip (as every year) and the macro mode on camera. I really don‚Äôt care about the new buttons nor the AI. üå∏",2025-02-25
forswunke,"Agreed, why pay more for AI",2025-02-25
ReginaDelMare,"I recently bought 15 in pink, although the price for the 16 wasn‚Äôt much higher. But I just couldn‚Äôt force myself to buy the colours that I don‚Äôt really like - 16 pink isn‚Äôt as beautiful as the 15 üòç",2025-02-25
Shookinnit,Yeah I‚Äôm not really a big picture girl and the apple ai doesn‚Äôt seem appealing to me but I still want a phone that last like long and be future save? I guess. I‚Äôve had the 11 since it was released so yeah.,2025-02-25

Nalsa-,There‚Äôs literally no reason to get iPhone 15 on a 60 eur difference.,2025-02-26
Chronixx,There‚Äôs a clear bias here since you probably have a 15. The 16 is literally a better device in every single way lol,2025-02-26
